# Analysis
Contains the analysis code for the project: **An inductive bias for slowly changing features in human reinforcement learning**. 


## Contents

### Behavioural Results
* `01_validate_learning.R`: Plots and tests to validate whether participants learned the task. 
* `02_test_effect.R`: Main and supplementary tests of the effect of feature speed on learning. 
* `03_plot_effect.R`: Plots to go with the tests in 2. 
* `04_meta_analysis.R`: Meta-analysis across the three experiment samples. 


### Modelling Results
* `05_modelling.R`: Plot the results of the model fitting. 
* `06_plot_effect_simulation.R`: Plot simulated model reward with slow > fast learning rates. 
* `07_plot_recover.R`: Plot the results of model recovery. 

### Helper Functions
* `ggplot_settings.R`
* `load.R`
